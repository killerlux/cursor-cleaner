# Cursor Cleaner & Machine ID Reset Script

A robust script for completely removing the Cursor application and its associated configuration data from Debian/Ubuntu systems. This script also resets the system's machine ID, which may help bypass trial limitations based on this identifier.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNINGS

1. **HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE**: This script uses `rm -rf` which forcefully deletes files and directories without confirmation (beyond the initial script confirmation). Mistakes can lead to data loss or system damage.
2. **DATA LOSS**: All Cursor settings, cache, local history (if any not synced), and related configuration will be permanently deleted. Back up anything important beforehand.
3. **MACHINE ID RESET**: Changing the machine ID is generally safe but might affect other software relying on it (rare). A reboot is required.
4. **NO GUARANTEES**: This script might not be sufficient to bypass all trial mechanisms. Cursor could use other identifiers (MAC address, online account, etc.).
5. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: The author(s) are not responsible for any damage or data loss caused by using this script. Review the code carefully.
6. **ETHICAL USE**: This script is provided for educational and testing purposes. Please respect software licenses and terms of service. Consider supporting developers by purchasing software you find valuable.
